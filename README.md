# webster

A new Flutter project.

## Points to Ponder

- Try to use lower-case-hiphen-seperated names for files.
- Try to Create appropriate directory for the files.
- Try to Use meaningful names for variables and functions.
- Try to use the theme color (Theme.of(context)) instead of hardcoded colors.
- Try to use the theme styles for text (Theme.of(context)) instead of hardcoded style.


- Try to make a branch for PR and merge later if no conflicts.
